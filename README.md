# Not Stack Overflow

---
This is a stackoverflow-like full-stack (too many stacks) application, that I started to develop during my 
internship at :iTechArt and continue to work on as of today. 

I basically use this whole thing as a playground to try out new things and learn new technologies and approaches 
that I'm curious about.

### Project's How To

If you wanna play around with this app, here's what you should do:

1. Clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/Timofei-Benko/itechart-final-project.git
```

2. Proceed to instructions according to what part of the app you are interested in: 
* [Server](server/rest/README.md)
* Client (it is unfinished and sucks, I will rewrite the whole thing from scratch :hand_over_mouth:)
